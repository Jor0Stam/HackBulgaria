tuple - const list
set - list with only unique items

list comprehension - [EXPRESSION for VARIABLE in COLLECTION if CONDITION]
[EXPRESSION for VARIABLE in COLLECTION for VARIABLE in COLLECTION if CONDITION]

also works for sets, dicts and tupels

{KEY(uses collection): VALUE(uses collection) for VARIABLE in COLLECTION}

creating lists with fewer lines but slower - not very efective for math algorithms on steroids
